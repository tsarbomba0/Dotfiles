Comment=Po naciśnięciu Alt+Ctrl+H będzie symulowane wejście 'Hello', dokładnie tak, jak się to wpisuje. Szczególnie użyteczne jeśli nie chce się wpisywać rzeczy takich jak 'unsigned'. Każde naciśnięcie klawisza na wejściu jest oddzielone dwukropkiem. Naciśnięcia klawiszy oznaczają rzeczywiste naciśnięcia, więc trzeba naprawdę użyć klawiatury. W tablicy poniżej lewa kolumna pokazuje wejście, a prawa to, co trzeba wpisać.\n\n"enter" (np. nowy wiersz)                   Enter \na (czyli mała litera a)                          A \nA (czyli wielka litera a)                        Shift+A \n: (dwukropek)                                    Shift+; \n' '  (odstęp)                                    Spacja

Comment=Najpierw przeczytaj komentarz do akcji "Wpisz 'Hello'".\n\nQt Designer używa Ctrl+F4 do zamykania okien (Ctrl+F4 w KDE oznacza jednak przejście do wirtualnego pulpitu numer 4, więc nie działa to w Qt Designerze). Dodatkowo, Qt Designer nie obsługuje zamykania okien standardowym skrótem KDE Ctrl+W.\n\nTen problem można rozwiązać przez przemapowanie działania Ctrl+F4 na Ctrl+W kiedy aktywnym oknem jest Qt Designer. Wtedy po każdym naciśnięciu Ctrl+W (jeśli oczywiście odbywa się to w oknie Designera), otrzyma on Ctrl+F4. Rzecz jasna, w innych programach Ctrl+W będzie działać tak jak poprzednio.\n\nTrzeba teraz podać trzy rzeczy: nowy skrót uaktywniany przy 'Ctrl+W', nowe działanie polegające na wysłaniu Ctrl+F4 oraz warunek, który będzie spełniony jeśli aktywnym oknem jest Qt Designer. \nQt Designer ma zawsze tytuł 'Qt Designer by Trolltech', więc warunek sprowadzi się do sprawdzenia, czy okno ma taki tytuł.

Comment=Przeczytaj najpierw komentarz na temat akcji "Wpisz 'Hello'".\n\nTak jak w przypadku "Wpisz 'Hello'", symulujemy tu wciśnięcie klawisza. Dokładniej, po naciśnięciu Ctrl+Alt+B następuje wysłanie B do XMMS (co powoduje przejście do następnego utworu). Jeśli zaznaczona jest opcja 'Wyślij do określonego okna' i podane jest okno zawierające klasę 'XMMS_Player', to klawisz zostanie zawsze wysłany do tego okna. W ten sposób można sterować XMMS-em nawet jeśli znajduje się na innym pulpicie.\n\n(Uruchom 'xprop' i kliknij okno XMMS, potem wyszukaj WM_CLASS, a zobaczysz 'XMMS_Player').

Comment=Konqueror w KDE 3.1 ma karty, a teraz także można korzystać z gestów. Nie trzeba używać innych przeglądarek...\n\nWciśnij środkowy przycisk myszy i rozpocznij rysowanie jednego z gestów. Po zakończeniu puść przycisk. Jeśli potrzebujesz wkleić zawartość schowka, to ta funkcja ciągle działa: po prostu jedno kliknięcie środkowym klawiszem (w ustawieniach globalnych można zmienić wykorzystywany do tego klawisz).\n\nObecnie dostępne są następujące gesty:\nw prawo i w lewo - W przód (Alt+prawo)\nw lewo i w prawo - W tył (Alt+lewo)\ndo góry i na dół - Do góry (Alt+góra)\nokrąg przeciwnie do ruchu wskazówek zegara - Odśwież (F5)\n\nKształty gestów mogą być po prostu wpisane przez wykonanie ich w oknie dialogowym konfiguracji. Możesz także ułatwić sobie wpisywanie przez to, że gesty są rozpoznawane jako tablica 3x3, jak klawiatura numeryczna i mają takie same numery od 1 do 9.\n\nPamiętaj, że gest trzeba wykonać dokładnie, żeby zadziałał. Z tego powodu można przypisać jednemu działaniu więcej gestów. Powinno się unikać skomplikowanych kombinacji, w których zmienia się kierunek ruchu myszy więcej niż jeden raz (45654 czy 74123 są proste w porównaniu do 1236987).\n\nWarunek dla każdego gestu jest zdefiniowany w tej grupie. Wszystkie gesty są dostępne tylko jeśli aktywnym oknem jest Konqueror (klasa zawiera 'konqueror').
